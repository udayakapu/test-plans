2. Introduction
2.1 Objectives. A system test plan for the corporate payroll system should support the following objectives:
(1)	To detail the activities required to prepare for and conduct the system test.
(2)	To communicate to all responsible parties the tasks that they are to perform and the schedule to be followed in performing the tasks.
(3)	To define the sources of the information used to prepare the plan.
(4)	To define the test tools and environment needed to conduct the system test.
2.2 Background. Last year the XYZ Corporate Systems and Programming Department developed a new General Ledger System at the request of the Corporate Accounting Department. A request was made at the same time for a new corporate payroll system to be developed that would interface with the general ledger system.
The Management Systems Review Committee approved the request for the payroll system in September of 19xx and named a corporate payroll system advisory group to decide on the system requirements. The group finished a Statement of Requirements (AP01-01) and a Preliminary Development Plan (AP01-02) in December 19xx.
2.3 Scope. This test plan covers a full systems test of the corporate payroll system. This includes operator and user procedures, as well as programs and job control. In addition to comprehensively testing multipro¬gram functionality, external interfaces, security, recovery, and performance will also be evaluated.
2.4 References. The following documents were used as sources of information for the test plan:
Corporate Payroll System Preliminary Development Plan (AP01-02)
Corporate Payroll System Authorization (AP01-03)
Corporate Payroll System Final Development Plan (AP01-06)
Corporate Payroll System Quality Assurance Plan (AP01-08)
Corporate Payroll System Configuration Management Plan (AP01-09)
XYZ Corporate Systems Development Standards and Procedures (XYZ01-0100)
Corporate General Ledger System Design Description (AG01-04)
Corporate General Ledger System Test Plan (AG05-01)
3. Test items
All items that make up the corporate payroll system will be tested during the system test. The versions to be tested will be placed in the appropriate libraries by the configuration administrator. The administrator will also control changes to the versions under test and notify the test group when new versions are available.
The following documents will provide the basis for defining correct operation:
Corporate Payroll System Statement of Requirements (AP01-01) Corporate Payroll System Design Description (AP01-04) Corporate Payroll System Reference Manual (AP02-01) Corporate Payroll System Module Reference Manual (AP02-03)
 
IEEE
Std 829-1998	IEEE STANDARD FOR
The items to be tested are as follows:
3.1 Program modules. The program modules to be tested will be identified as follows:
Type	Library	Member name
Source Code	SOURLIB1	AP0302
AP0305
Executable Code	MACLIB1	AP0301
AP0302
AP0305
3.2 Job control procedures. The control procedures for application programs, sorts, and utility programs will be identified as follows:
Type	Library	Member name
Application Programs PROCLIB1	AP0401
Sorts	PROCLIB1	AP0402
Utility Programs	PROCLIB1	AP0403
3.3 User procedures. The on-line procedures specified in the Corporate Payroll System User Transaction Reference Manual (AP02-04) will be tested.
3.4 Operator procedures. The system test includes the procedures specified in the Corporate Payroll System Operation Reference Manual (AP02-02).
4. Features to be tested
The following list describes the features that will be tested:
Test design
specification number	Description
AP06-01	Database conversion
AP06-02	Complete payroll processing for salaried employees only
AP06-03	Complete payroll processing for hourly employees only
AP06-04	Complete payroll processing for all employees
AP06-05	Periodic reporting
AP06-06	General Ledger transaction building
AP06-07	Security
AP06-08	Recovery
AP06-09	Performance
5. Features not to be tested
The following features will not be included in the system tests because they are not to be used when the system is initially installed:
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Compliance Reports Internal Training Schedule Reports Salary/Performance Review Reports
 
IEEE
SOFTWARE TEST DOCUMENTATION	Std 829-1998
The development Phase 2.0 documentation will contain a test plan for these features.
The test cases will not cover all possible combinations of options within the transaction or report being tested. Only combinations that are known to be required for current XYZ Corporate Payroll processing will be tested.
6. Approach
The test personnel will use the system documentation to prepare all test design, case, and procedure specifi¬cations. This approach will verify the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information in the documenta¬tion in those areas covered by the tests.
Personnel from the Payroll and Corporate Accounting Departments will assist in developing the test designs and test cases. This will help ensure that the tests represent the production use of the system.
In order to ensure privacy, all test data extracted from production files will have privacy-sensitive fields changed.
6.1 Conversion testing. In addition to counting the input and output records, the validity of the converted database will be verified in two ways. The first verification method involves the use of a database auditor that must be built by the development group. When run against the converted database, the database auditor will check value ranges within a record and the required relationships between records.
The second verification method involves the random selection of a small subset of old records and then a direct comparison against a corresponding subset of the new records. The number of direct comparisons, c, and the number of old records, r, must be specified. A set of c random numbers will be generated from the range 1 to r. This set will be sorted and used during the conversion process to drive the selection of records for direct comparison.
NOTE—This same two-pronged verification approach should be used during the actual conversion.
6.2 Job stream testing. A comprehensive set of records of salaried employees, hourly employees, and a merged set of these two should be used to test payroll processing. The standard job stream testing approach should be used.
Run each of the periodic reporting job streams at least once.
6.3 Interface testing. In order to test the interface between the payroll and general ledger systems, the payroll system will build a comprehensive set of general ledger transactions. These transactions will then be input to the general ledger test system. The resulting general ledger entries must be extracted, printed, and compared with a printout of the general ledger transactions prepared by the payroll system.
6.4 Security testing. Attempted access without a proper password to the on-line data entry and display transactions will be tested.
6.5 Recovery testing. Recovery will be tested by halting the machine during stand-alone time and then following the recovery procedures.
6.6 Performance testing. Performance will be evaluated against the performance requirements (AP01-01) by measuring the run times of several jobs using production data volumes.
6.7 Regression. It is assumed that several iterations of the system test will be done in order to test program modifications made during the system test period. A regression test will be performed for each new version of the system to detect unexpected impact resulting from program modifications.
 
IEEE
Std 829-1998	IEEE STANDARD FOR
The regression test will be done by running all of the tests on a new version that were run on the previous version and then comparing the resulting files. The standard comparator program, UT08-0100, will be used to compare all system outputs.
6.8 Comprehensiveness. Each of the system features described in the Corporate Payroll System Reference Manual (AP02-01) will have at least one associated test design specification. Each of the user procedures specified in the Corporate Payroll System User Transaction Reference Manual (AP02-04) will be tested at least once. Each of the operating procedures specified in the Corporate Payroll System Operation Reference Manual (AP02-02) also will be tested at least once. In addition, each job control procedure will be executed at least once.
A coverage matrix will be used to related test design specifications to each of the areas described above.
6.9 Constraints. A final implementation date of August 31, 19xx has been planned for the Corporate Payroll System. It will be necessary to meet this date because the new ABC Division begins full operation on September 1, and they must have this payroll system to pay their employees.
7. Item pass/fail criteria
The system must satisfy the standard requirements for system pass/fail stated in the XYZ Corporate Systems Development Standards and Procedures (XYZ01-0100).
The system must also satisfy the following requirements:
- Memory requirements must not be greater than 64K of real storage.
- Consistency of user procedures with other accounting systems must satisfy the Payroll Supervisor.
8. Suspension criteria and resumption requirements
8.1 Suspension criteria. Inability to convert the Employee Information Database will cause suspension of all testing activities.
8.2 Resumption requirements. When a new version of the system is transmitted to the test group after a suspension of testing has occurred, a regression test as described in 6.7 will be run.
9. Test deliverables
The following documents will be generated by the system test group and will be delivered to the configura¬tion management group after test completion.
Test documentation:
System Test Plan
System Test Design Specifications System Test Case Specifications System Test Procedure Specifications System Test Logs
System Test Incident Report Log System Test Incident Reports System Test Summary Report
Test data:
(1)	Copies of all data entry and inquiry screens and the reply screens are to be attached to the related test case document.
(2)	Copies of the input and output test files should be delivered to the configuration management group.
(3)	Microfiche copies of the printed output from the final execution of each test procedure are to be delivered to the configuration management group along with the test documentation.
